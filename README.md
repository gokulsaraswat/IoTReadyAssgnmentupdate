# IoTReadyAssignment
In this project i created three xml for:
* Listview 
* Portrait view
* Landscape view

In Mainactivity i created array of data and values and pass them to elements of listview such that list is generated.

By Creating a CustomListview using customAdaptor and aligning the elements the project coult be completed
Two Buttons and one TextView is also added such to mimic the assignment.
